# virtual_memory

### Student project (January 2018)
##### Build and runned with Visual Studio 2015

* Implementation of virtual memory in CPU module.
* Allocation and Deallocation space for Segments and Pages of each process that is started in System. Thrashing is not eliminated with this solution because of FIFO algorithm for Frame replace. 
* This memory works with disk simulation that is located in "part" folder that need to be include in project when compile.
* In "javni_test_v1.1" and "javni_test_v1.2" are tests for project demonstration.
